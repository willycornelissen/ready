# Excalidraw Studio

Generate Excalidraw-format diagrams from natural language descriptions. Outputs `.excalidraw` JSON files that can be opened directly in Excalidraw (web, VS Code extension, or Obsidian plugin).

## Workflow

```
UNDERSTAND → CHOOSE TYPE → EXTRACT → GENERATE → SAVE
```

### Step 1: Understand the Request

Analyze the user's description to determine:

1. **Diagram type** — Use the decision matrix below
2. **Key elements** — Entities, steps, concepts, actors
3. **Relationships** — Flow direction, connections, hierarchy
4. **Complexity** — Number of elements (target: under 20 for clarity)

### Step 2: Choose the Diagram Type and Visual Mode

**Diagram type:**

| User Intent                | Diagram Type         | Keywords                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Process flow, steps        | **Flowchart**        | "workflow", "process", "steps"                |
| Connections, dependencies  | **Relationship**     | "relationship", "connections", "dependencies" |
| Concept hierarchy          | **Mind Map**         | "mind map", "concepts", "breakdown"           |
| System design              | **Architecture**     | "architecture", "system", "components"        |
| Data movement              | **Data Flow (DFD)**  | "data flow", "data processing"                |
| Cross-functional processes | **Swimlane**         | "business process", "swimlane", "actors"      |
| Object-oriented design     | **Class Diagram**    | "class", "inheritance", "OOP"                 |
| Interaction sequences      | **Sequence Diagram** | "sequence", "interaction", "messages"         |
| Database design            | **ER Diagram**       | "database", "entity", "data model"            |

**Visual mode** — decide upfront and apply consistently to all elements:

| Mode       | `roughness` | `fontFamily` | When to use                                          |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sketch** | `1`         | `5`          | Default — informal, approachable, Excalidraw-native  |
| **Clean**  | `0`         | `2`          | Executive presentations, formal specs                |
| **Mixed**  | zones: `0`, shapes: `1` | `5` | Architecture diagrams (structural zones + sketchy shapes) |

### Step 3: Extract Structured Information

Extract the key components based on diagram type. For each type, identify:

- **Nodes/entities** — What are the boxes/shapes?
- **Connections** — What connects to what, and with what label?
- **Hierarchy** — What contains what, what comes before what?
- **Decision points** — Where does the flow branch?

For detailed extraction guidelines per diagram type, read `references/element-types.md`.

### Step 4: Generate the Excalidraw JSON

**CRITICAL: Read `references/excalidraw-schema.md` before generating your first diagram.** It contains the correct element format, text container model, and binding system.

Key rules for generation:

1. **Text inside shapes** — Use `boundElements` on the shape and a separate text element with `containerId`. Never use a `label` shorthand:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "step-1",
       "type": "rectangle",
       "x": 100, "y": 100, "width": 200, "height": 80,
       "boundElements": [{ "type": "text", "id": "text-step-1" }]
     },
     {
       "id": "text-step-1",
       "type": "text",
       "x": 130, "y": 128, "width": 140, "height": 24,
       "text": "My Step", "originalText": "My Step",
       "fontSize": 20, "fontFamily": 5,
       "textAlign": "center", "verticalAlign": "middle",
       "containerId": "step-1", "lineHeight": 1.25, "roundness": null
     }
   ]
   ```

2. **Arrow labels** — Also use `boundElements` + separate text element with `containerId`. Never use a `label` shorthand on arrows:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "arrow-1",
       "type": "arrow",
       "x": 100, "y": 150,
       "points": [[0, 0], [200, 0]],
       "boundElements": [{ "type": "text", "id": "text-arrow-1" }]
     },
     {
       "id": "text-arrow-1",
       "type": "text",
       "x": 160, "y": 132, "width": 80, "height": 18,
       "text": "sends data", "originalText": "sends data",
       "fontSize": 14, "fontFamily": 5,
       "textAlign": "center", "verticalAlign": "middle",
       "containerId": "arrow-1", "lineHeight": 1.25, "roundness": null
     }
   ]
   ```

3. **Arrow bindings** — Use `startBinding`/`endBinding` (not `start`/`end`). Connected shapes must list the arrow in their `boundElements`:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "shape-1",
     "boundElements": [
       { "type": "text", "id": "text-shape-1" },
       { "type": "arrow", "id": "arrow-1" }
     ]
   }
   ```
   ```json
   {
     "id": "arrow-1",
     "type": "arrow",
     "startBinding": { "elementId": "shape-1", "focus": 0, "gap": 1 },
     "endBinding": { "elementId": "shape-2", "focus": 0, "gap": 1 }
   }
   ```

4. **Element order for z-index** — Always declare shapes first, arrows second, text elements last. This guarantees text renders on top and is never obscured by arrows or other shapes.

5. **Positioning** — Use grid-aligned coordinates (multiples of 20px when `gridSize: 20`). Leave 200-300px horizontal gap, 100-150px vertical gap between elements.

6. **Unique IDs** — Every element must have a unique `id`. Use descriptive IDs like `"step-1"`, `"decision-valid"`, `"arrow-1-to-2"`, `"text-step-1"`.

7. **Colors** — Use a consistent palette:

   | Role | Color | Hex |
   |------|-------|-----|
   | Primary entities | Light blue | `#a5d8ff` |
   | Process steps | Light green | `#b2f2bb` |
   | Important/Central | Yellow | `#ffd43b` |
   | Warnings/Errors | Light red | `#ffc9c9` |
   | Secondary | Cyan | `#96f2d7` |
   | Default stroke | Dark | `#1e1e1e` |

### Step 5: Save and Present

1. Save as `<descriptive-name>.excalidraw`
2. Provide a summary:

   ```
   Created: user-workflow.excalidraw
   Type: Flowchart
   Elements: 7 shapes, 6 arrows, 1 title
   Total: 14 elements

   To view:
   1. Visit https://excalidraw.com → Open → drag and drop the file
   2. Or use the Excalidraw VS Code extension
   3. Or open in Obsidian with the Excalidraw plugin
   ```

## Templates

Pre-built templates are available in `assets/` for quick starting points. Use these when the diagram type matches — they provide correct structure and styling:

| Template         | File                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Flowchart        | `assets/flowchart-template.json`                    |
| Relationship     | `assets/relationship-template.json`                 |
| Mind Map         | `assets/mindmap-template.json`                      |
| Data Flow (DFD)  | `assets/data-flow-diagram-template.json`            |
| Swimlane         | `assets/business-flow-swimlane-template.json`       |
| Class Diagram    | `assets/class-diagram-template.json`                |
| Sequence Diagram | `assets/sequence-diagram-template.json`             |
| ER Diagram       | `assets/er-diagram-template.json`                   |

Read a template when creating that diagram type for the first time. Use its structure as a base, then modify elements to match the user's request.

## Icon Libraries

For professional architecture diagrams with service icons (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.), icon libraries can be set up. Read `references/icon-libraries.md` when:

- User requests an AWS/cloud architecture diagram
- User mentions wanting specific service icons
- You need to check if icon libraries are available

## Best Practices

### Element Count

| Diagram Type          | Recommended | Maximum |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Flowchart steps       | 3-10        | 15      |
| Relationship entities | 3-8         | 12      |
| Mind map branches     | 4-6         | 8       |
| Sub-topics per branch | 2-4         | 6       |

If the user's request exceeds maximum, suggest breaking into multiple diagrams:

> "Your request includes 15 components. For clarity, I recommend: (1) High-level architecture diagram with 6 main components, (2) Detailed sub-diagrams for each subsystem. Want me to start with the high-level view?"

### Layout

- **Flow direction**: Left-to-right for processes, top-to-bottom for hierarchies
- **Spacing**: 200-300px horizontal, 100-150px vertical between elements
- **Grid alignment**: Position on multiples of 20px for clean alignment
- **Margins**: Minimum 50px from canvas edge
- **Text sizing**: 28-36px titles, 18-22px labels, 14-16px annotations
- **Font**: Use `fontFamily: 5` (Excalifont) for hand-drawn consistency. Fallback to `1` (Virgil) if 5 is not supported.
- **Background zones**: For architecture diagrams, add semi-transparent dashed zone rectangles (`opacity: 35`, `strokeStyle: "dashed"`, `roughness: 0`) as the first elements in the array to create visual grouping regions. See `references/excalidraw-schema.md` → Background Zones.
- **Element order**: zones first → shapes → arrows → text elements (ensures correct z-index and text always renders on top)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Using `label: { text: "..." }` shorthand on shapes or arrows — not supported by the Excalidraw parser
- ❌ Putting `text` directly on shape elements without `containerId`
- ❌ Using `start`/`end` for arrow bindings — use `startBinding`/`endBinding` with `elementId`/`focus`/`gap`
- ❌ Forgetting to add arrows to their connected shapes' `boundElements` arrays
- ❌ Omitting `originalText`, `lineHeight`, `autoResize`, or `backgroundColor: "transparent"` from text elements inside containers
- ❌ Omitting required base properties (`angle`, `strokeStyle`, `opacity`, `groupIds`, `frameId`, `index`, `isDeleted`, `seed`, `version`, `versionNonce`, `updated`, `link`, `locked`) — elements will not render
- ❌ Missing `"files": {}` at the top level of the JSON
- ❌ Using `roundness: { "type": 3 }` on ellipses — ellipses must use `roundness: null`
- ❌ Missing `lastCommittedPoint`, `startArrowhead`, `endArrowhead` on arrows
- ❌ Declaring text elements before arrows — text renders underneath and gets obscured
- ❌ Floating arrows without bindings (won't move with shapes)
- ❌ Overlapping elements (increase spacing)
- ❌ Inconsistent color usage (define palette upfront)
- ❌ Too many elements on one diagram (break into sub-diagrams)

## Validation Checklist

Before delivering the diagram, verify:

- [ ] All elements have unique IDs
- [ ] Every element has ALL required base properties: `angle`, `strokeStyle`, `opacity`, `groupIds`, `frameId`, `index`, `isDeleted`, `link`, `locked`, `seed`, `version`, `versionNonce`, `updated`
- [ ] `index` values are assigned in order (`"a0"`, `"a1"`, …) with text elements getting higher values than shapes/arrows
- [ ] Top-level JSON includes `"files": {}`
- [ ] Shapes with text use `boundElements` + separate text element with `containerId`
- [ ] Text elements inside containers have `containerId`, `originalText`, `lineHeight: 1.25`, `autoResize: true`, `roundness: null`, `backgroundColor: "transparent"`
- [ ] Arrows use `startBinding`/`endBinding` (with `elementId`, `focus`, `gap`) when connecting shapes, plus `lastCommittedPoint: null`, `startArrowhead: null`, `endArrowhead: "arrow"`
- [ ] Connected shapes list the arrow in their `boundElements` arrays
- [ ] Element order: shapes → arrows → text elements (text always on top)
- [ ] Ellipses use `roundness: null` (not `{ "type": 3 }`)
- [ ] Coordinates prevent overlapping (check spacing)
- [ ] Text is readable (font size 16+)
- [ ] Colors follow consistent scheme
- [ ] File is valid JSON
- [ ] Element count is reasonable (<20 for clarity)

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                         | Solution                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text not showing in shapes    | Use `boundElements` + separate text element with `containerId`, `originalText`, `lineHeight`  |
| Text hidden behind arrows     | Move text elements to end of `elements` array (after all arrows)                             |
| Arrows don't move with shapes | Use `startBinding`/`endBinding` with `elementId`, `focus: 0`, `gap: 1`                       |
| Shape not moving with arrows  | Add the arrow to the shape's `boundElements` array                                            |
| Elements overlap              | Increase spacing between coordinates                                                          |
| Text doesn't fit              | Increase shape width or reduce font size                                                      |
| Too many elements             | Break into multiple diagrams                                                                  |
| Colors look inconsistent      | Define color palette upfront, apply consistently                                              |

## Limitations

- Complex curves are simplified to straight/basic curved lines
- Hand-drawn roughness is set to default (1)
- No embedded images in auto-generation (use icon libraries for service icons)
- Maximum recommended: 20 elements per diagram for clarity
- No automatic collision detection — use spacing guidelines
